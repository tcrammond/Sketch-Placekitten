# Placekitten Sketch plugin

A plugin to quickly include **kittens** from [Placekitten](http://placekitten.com/) in your Sketch projects.

Forked from the wonderful [Unsplash It Sketch](https://github.com/fhuel/Unsplash-It-Sketch)

**Note:** Currently the plugin will sometimes crash Sketch if Placekitten fails to provide an image for a particular set of dimensions. Trying to handle these errors is proving difficult.

## Installation

1. Download Zip and Extract it to a folder
2. In Sketch app Plugins > Reveal Plugins folder...
3. Place the extracted folder directly to the Plugins folder


## Usage

1. Create one or more shapes and select them
2. Run the plugin from the plugins menu or you can use the shortcut cmd + shift + u
3. That's it, your shape(s) will become beautiful placeholder images
